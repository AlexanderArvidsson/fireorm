# Examples

Here you can find many examples of how to use fireorm in multiple scenarios!

First you must create a file called `firestore.creds.json` with firestore credentials (see how to do it in [firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup), we also provide `firestore.creds.example.json` as an example). Then you can run the examples by invoking node and requiring ts-config (`node -r ts-node/register path_to_example.js`) or debug using [VS Code's built-in debugger](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging).
